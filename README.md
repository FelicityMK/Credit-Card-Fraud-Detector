Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning app that detects fraudulent transactions using an imbalanced dataset of over 280,000 records. 
Powered by XGBoost, balanced using SMOTE, and deployed via Streamlit.


 Project Overview

-**Due to GitHubâ€™s file size restrictions, the full `creditcard.csv` dataset is **not included** in this repository.To run the project locally, please download the dataset from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), and place it inside the `data/` folder as: `creditcard.csv`
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Goal:** Accurately identify fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall.
- **Best Performing Model:** XGBoost with a ROC AUC score of **0.97**.
  

Key Features
- Handles severe class imbalance using ** SMOTE** oversampling.
- Compares four ML models; Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost.
- Uses **StandardScaler** for consistent scaling.
- Saves trained model ('xgboost_model.pkl') and scaler ('scaler.pkl') for deployment or future
  

Models Trained


| Model               | ROC AUC Score | Precision (Fraud) | Recall (Fraud) |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.96          | 0.84              | 0.70           |
| Random Forest       | 0.95          | 0.88              | 0.80           |
| **XGBoost**         | **0.98**      | **0.84**          | **0.80**       |
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.97          | 0.20              | 0.86           |

> **XGBoost** selected as the final model due to its excellent balance of precision and recall.


 Tech Stack

 Saved Artifacts
xgboost_model.pkl: Trained XGBoost model
scaler.pkl: StandardScaler used for test data normalization


Model Performance
Best performing model: XGBoost
ROC AUC Score: 0.9679


Notes
The dataset is highly imbalanced. SMOTE helps rebalance before model training.
Only the best-performing model and scaler are saved for later inference.
