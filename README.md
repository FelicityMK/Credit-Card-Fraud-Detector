Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
A machine learning app that detects fraudulent transactions using an imbalanced dataset of over 280,000 records.
Powered by XGBoost, balanced with SMOTE, and deployed via Streamlit.

Project Overview

Due to GitHubâ€™s file size restrictions, the full creditcard.csv dataset is not included in this repo.
To run the project locally, download it from Kaggle and place it in the Data/ folder as:
Data/creditcard.csv

Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
Goal: Accurately identify fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall.
Best Performing Model: XGBoost with a ROC AUC score of 0.97

Key Features
1.Tackles extreme class imbalance using SMOTE
2.Trains and compares 4 ML models:
3.Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost
4.Applies StandardScaler for consistent feature scaling

Saves best model (xgboost_model.pkl) and scaler (scaler.pkl) for deployment

Models Trained
| Model               | ROC AUC Score | Precision (Fraud) | Recall (Fraud) |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.96          | 0.84              | 0.70           |
| Random Forest       | 0.95          | 0.88              | 0.80           |
| **XGBoost**         | **0.98**      | **0.84**          | **0.80**       |
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.97          | 0.20              | 0.86           |

XGBoost was selected as the final model due to its strong balance of precision and recall.

Tech Stack

How to Run
1.Clone the repository; git clone https://github.com/FelicityMK/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detector.git
2.Install dependencies; pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Train the model; python Train_model.py
4.Run the app; streamlit run app.py

Demo
ðŸ”— Try it live on Streamlit (add your Streamlit app link here)
Or run it locally using the steps above.

Saved Artifacts
xgboost_model.pkl â€“ Best performing trained model
scaler.pkl â€“ StandardScaler used during model training

Model Performance
Best Model: XGBoost
ROC AUC Score: 0.9679
Precision (Fraud): 0.84
Recall (Fraud): 0.80
The dataset is highly imbalancedâ€”only ~0.17% of transactions are fraudulent.
SMOTE rebalancing was essential to improve model performance.

Next Steps
1.Add file upload functionality for real-time predictions
2.Deploy model with FastAPI for integration with other tools
3.Monitor model drift with incoming transaction data
